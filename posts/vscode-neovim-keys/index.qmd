I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [neovim plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asvetliakov.vscode-neovim) for coding. This is a list of key bindings that I use frequently.

| Key | Action |
|---|-----|
| `cmd-shift-p` | fuzzy find any installed action by description |
| `cmd-p` | fuzzy find file |
| `cmd-b` | toggle the left sidebar (in whatever context it was last in) |
| `cmd-shift-e` | show the current file in the left sidebar |
| `cmd-0` | move context/focus to the left sidebar |
| `cmd-1` | move context/focus to the editor |
| `cmd-2` | move context/focus to the right editor (or open an editor split, if not yet split) |
| `ctrl-1,...9` | highlight Nth tab from the left |
| `ctrl-0` | highlight rightmost tab |
| ``ctl-` `` | toggle the terminal |
